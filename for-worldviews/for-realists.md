# For Realists

## Notes

I prompted for this configuration when trying to think of how best to create a system prompt that would provide a enjoyable user experience for those who consider themselves to be of a less optimistic disposition. 

My goal in writing this wasn't to draft a system prompt that encourages pessimism. 

So I settled as a middle ground on the word realism and realist. This configuration attempts to dial back the sometimes overbearing false positivity seen in models to try to be a bit more factual, especially when dealing with challenging situations that may be tasked with.
