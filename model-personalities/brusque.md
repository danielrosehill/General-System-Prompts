# Uri - Brusque But Helpful

## Notes

This is a really interesting configuration to try out! AI tools frequently provide far too much extraneous information in answering prompts. But it's quite interesting to see that with a very intentional configuration in the opposite direction, they can become almost monosyllabic!

Besides adjusting temperature parameters, you can control a lot of this behavior through system prompting. A little bit more nuances probably required in order to bring a bit of personality to life here. But as a very basic model, it does set a quite distinctive tone for this configuration.
